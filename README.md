 <summary><h3>👨‍💻 Kishore's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I didn't have much exposure during my schooling days because I always opted for life science fields. However, after joining university, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and I was at home most of the time. So, I started to explore various fields outside my domain, and one such field was Computer Science. I found out that I really loved programming and was fascinated with the field of Computer Science, especially with Web3. The concept of decentralization, defi really resonated with me.
