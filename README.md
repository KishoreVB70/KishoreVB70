 A Biotechnology graduate turned software engineer. This drastic turn took seed in early 2021 when a naive boy started university and the COVID-19 pandemic struck. With time on his hands and a curiosity for the unknown, he began exploring the field of computer science with no prior exposure. He was facinated by the ocncepts and within no time fell in love with programming and the concept of decentralization. Started learning the basic concepts through open source knowledge - [Harvard cs50](https://pll.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science), learned DSA basics through Java, moved on learning Web development with Js->React and Ethereum blockchain backend. Explored various fields such as AI development using python, Android development using Kotlin, Canister development(Rust, TS) in ICP blockchain. This diverse journey has not only broadened my technical skills but also solidified my passion for continuous learning and innovation. I'm always on the lookout for exciting projects, opportunities to collaborate and open for job offers

 <summary><h3>üë®‚Äçüíª Kishore's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  I didn't have much exposure during my schooling days because I always opted for life science fields. However, after joining university, the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and I was at home most of the time. So, I started to explore various fields outside my domain, and one such field was Computer Science. I found out that I really loved programming and was fascinated with the field of Computer Science, especially with Web3. The concept of decentralization, defi really resonated with me.
